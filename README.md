# TQRTLE.EXE
Free auto answer and tweak menu for Edgenuity, developed by Tqrtle and Defy (De-y)

# Requirements
- Tampermonkey Extention
- Web Browser compatible with Tampermonkey

# FREEWARE! EDGENUITY CHEATS FOR ALL!
This is purely to spread free cheats for anybody struggling with Edgenuity, we don't hate paid cheats but lets be real... most people who sell them are scumbags or script kiddies :)

# Legality
The IDs are purely sourced from TQRTLE, this script is a fork and ONLY includes the menu (developed by Defy), auto-submit (developed by Tqrtle), and auto-answer (answer IDs sourced from Tqrtle) none of these features involve me and the developers have these scripts public on their own pages as well. Please be aware that if I'm legally required to, this github page may possibly be taken down in the uncertain future.
